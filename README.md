# 🤖 CRM Agent - Inspiration and Exploration

Welcome to my first agent! I was inspired to start this project to learn how to build an intelligent Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system using AI agents, LangGraph, and real and synthezied customer data. Meet **Ralph** - your AI-powered marketing assistant who can analyze customer behavior, create personalized marketing campaigns, and automate email communications with Slack integrations.

Given the heavy prescence of customer analysis for optimization and marketing in the e-ccommerce landscape, I believe that an agent assistant to help one perform these activities and automate would be helpful :)

## 🎯 What I Learned

- Built an AI agent using **LangGraph** and **OpenAI**
- Implement **human-in-the-loop** workflows for sensitive operations
- Create **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis** for customer segmentation
- Design **personalized marketing campaigns** using AI
- Integrate **PostgreSQL** with AI agents for real-time data analysis
- Use **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** for tool integration

## ⚡ Quick Start

Want to get started immediately? Here's the fastest path:

This project uses `uv` for dependency management. If you don't have `uv` installed, follow the instructions [here](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/install-python/).

1. **Setup**:

   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd crm-agent
   uv sync  # Install dependencies
   ```

2. **Configure environment**:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your OpenAI API key and Supabase URI
   ```

3. **Setup database** (create free Supabase account at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)):

   - Create a new Supabase project. Use the generate_password feature to generate a secure password, copy it into the .env file for use later.
   - Copy the connection string from the Supabase project settings and paste it into the .env file (you'll see a 'connect' button at the top of the dashboard), replacing the placeholder with the actual connection string.
   - Replace the password placeholder with the password you generated earlier.
   - Copy and paste the sql from `db/migration-create-tables.sql` into the Supabase SQL editor. This will automatically create all of the db tables for you.
   - Import each CSV file from the `data` directory into the corresponding table in Supabase.

4. **Verify and run**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend && uv run python chat_local.py  # Start chatting with Ralph!
   ```

## 🎮 Running the Application

### Start the Chat Interface

```bash
cd frontend
uv run python chat_local.py
```

You should see Ralph introduce himself:

## 📊 Understanding the Data

### Customer Segments (RFM Analysis)

Ralph uses RFM analysis to categorize customers:

- **🏆 Champions** (555): Best customers - high recency, frequency, and monetary value
- **🆕 Recent Customers** (5XX): Recently active customers
- **🔄 Frequent Buyers** (X5X): Customers who buy often
- **💰 Big Spenders** (XX5): High-value customers
- **⚠️ At Risk** (1XX): Haven't purchased recently
- **👥 Others**: Everyone else

### Database Schema

The project includes these main tables:

- **customers**: Customer information and contact details
- **transactions**: Purchase history and transaction data
- **items**: Product catalog with descriptions and prices
- **rfm**: Customer segmentation scores
- **marketing_campaigns**: Campaign tracking
- **campaign_emails**: Email delivery and engagement tracking

## Adding New Tools

Create new MCP tools in `src/ralph/mymcp/servers/marketing_server.py`:

```python
@mcp.tool()
async def your_new_tool(param: str) -> str:
    """Your tool description."""
    # Your implementation here
    return "Tool result"
```
